## Introduction

Ah, the joy of another failed project. If you've worked in a company that claims to use agile methods, you’ve probably felt the mix of hope and disappointment that comes with project failure. Let’s explore why projects fail and how estimates are really made in these agile workplaces.

## The Agile Myth

First, let’s talk about the agile manifesto. It talks about “people and interactions over processes and tools” and “responding to change over following a plan.” Sounds great, right? In reality, it’s more like “people blaming each other while using bad tools” and “panicking over changes without a plan.”

## The Planning Poker Joke

Oh, planning poker – the game where developers guess how long tasks will take using playing cards. It’s a guessing game where no one really knows the answer. And then someone says “21” and you wonder if they’re talking about story points or making a random bet.

## The Sprint That Goes Nowhere

Sprints are supposed to be short, focused work periods. Instead, they often feel like long marathons where everyone runs but no one knows where they’re going. Goals are set too high, and halfway through, the team realizes they need to change direction because “the requirements have changed.” Hint: the requirements always change.

## Stand-up Comedy

Daily stand-ups are meant to be quick, efficient check-ins. In practice, they’re 15 minutes where team members say a lot without saying anything useful. It’s like a bad improv show where no one knows their lines.

## The Burndown Chart Illusion

Ah, the burndown chart. It’s a nice graph that shows the team’s progress – or lack thereof. Watching a burndown chart is like watching a clock ticking down while everyone insists they’ll make it on time. When the project misses its deadline, there’s always a meeting to discuss what went wrong. Hint: everything went wrong.

## The Guessing Game

Let’s talk about how estimates are really made. It’s not based on experience or data. No, it’s a mix of guesswork, wishful thinking, and luck. The product owner asks for an estimate, the developers guess a number, and everyone pretends it’s based on some real calculation. In reality, it’s more like throwing darts at a board while blindfolded.

## The Blame Game

When the project finally fails, it’s time for the blame game. The developers blame unclear requirements, the product owner blames the developers, and management blames everyone but themselves. It’s a circle of finger-pointing that solves nothing but makes everyone feel a bit better.

## Conclusion: The Inevitable Failure

In the end, project failure in agile companies is not a mistake; it’s a feature. It shows our ability to fool ourselves into thinking that next time will be different. Interestingly, I learned all these insights from my project management course, which highlighted these common pitfalls and taught me how to navigate them in real life. It’s clear that not everything from theory can be perfectly applied in the real world. So, here’s to the next sprint, the next stand-up, and the next set of wildly inaccurate estimates. May we never learn from our mistakes and continue to stumble forward in blissful ignorance. Cheers!
